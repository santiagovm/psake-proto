test project to play with psake and TeamCity
using PluralSight course as guide
"Continuous Integration with psake and TeamCity: Getting Started"



Issues:

- using old team city instead of new one because new one is stuck stopping. Need acess to new one to see what the problem is

- using NuGet 2.8.3 and that has problems with xUnit. I don't have the path to NuGet 3.3 in the old server. Need to access the server to find the path

- using GitHub instead of eGifter repo because I have permission. David set it up, but it is not working. As a workaround I used GitHub
